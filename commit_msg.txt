feat: Implement binary data handling in MariaDB integration

Add support for storing and retrieving binary data with proper JSON serialization:

- Add BinaryTest to validate binary data handling
- Implement custom JSON serializer for binary data that:
  - Detects binary content by checking for non-printable chars
  - Converts binary data to hex string representation in JSON
  - Preserves regular string data as-is
- Use MYSQL_TYPE_BLOB for binary storage and MYSQL_TYPE_STRING for text
- Add tmp/ directory to .gitignore
- Clean up test runner code structure

The implementation ensures accurate handling of binary data while maintaining
readable JSON output. Binary values are stored efficiently in the database
and presented as hex strings (e.g. "FF00") in JSON responses.
